    answers:
      - 0

  - question: How do you decide the order of splitting the data set?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
    options:
      - low entropy
      - low randomness
      - high information

  - question: What is Gini impurity?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
    options:
      - Gini impurity is a function that determines how well a decision tree was split.
      - It helps us to determine which splitter is best so that we can build a pure decision tree.
      - Impurity in our dataset.

  - question: Gini impurity ranges values from 0 to 0.5.
    options:
      - Yes
      - No
    answers:
      - 0

  - question: What is label encoder?
    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - One of the ways to convert labels to numbers that machines can understand
      - encodes labels for better understanding of humans
      - creates labels from codes

  - question: What are the differnces between Gini and Entropy?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
    options:
      - Computationally, entropy is more complex since it makes use of logarithms and consequently, the calculation of the Gini Index will be faster.
      - Gini Index has values inside the interval [0, 0.5] whereas the interval of the Entropy is [0, 1].
      - Computationally, Gini Index is more complex since it makes use of logarithms and consequently, the calculation of the Entropy will be faster.
