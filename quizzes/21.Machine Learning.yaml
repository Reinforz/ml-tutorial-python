topic: Machine Learning
subject: Bias vs Variance in Machine Learning
questions:
  - question: What is high variance ?
    answers:
      - 0

    options:
      - When the test error varies greatly based on the selection of train datapoints then it means there is high variance
      - When the datapoints in a dataset vary greatly

  - question: In case of high variance using overfit model, the train error is generally zero.
    options:
      - Yes
      - No
    answers:
      - 0

  - question: What is bias in machine learning?
    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - Bias is a phenomenon that skews the result of an algorithm in favor or against an idea.
      - A low bias model will closely match the training data set.
      - A high bias model will give high training dataset error

  - question: Select the characteristics of the balanced fit model.
    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - low variance and low bias
      - high bias and high variance
      - high bias and low variance
