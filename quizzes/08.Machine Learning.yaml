  - question: What is the problem with using linear regression to build prediction models for categorical classification type problems?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 2
    options:
      - Extreme values will shift the line and give incorrect predictions
      - It can only work with continous linear datasets (where the predicted value is continous)
      - It is not suitable to use with categorical values

  - question: y=1/(1+e^-(mx+b)) is the sigmoid function used for logistic regression.

      - Yes
      - No
    answers:
      - 0

  - question: What is used to determine the instances where our trained models failed to perform well?
    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - Confusion Matrix
      - One hot Encoding
      - Regression models
