    options:
      - It is a tool used to transform a given text into a vector on the basis of the frequency (count) of each word that occurs in the entire text.
      - CountVectorizer creates a matrix in which each unique word is represented by a column of the matrix, and each text sample from the document is a row in the matrix. T
      - he value of each cell is nothing but the count of the word in that particular text sample.
