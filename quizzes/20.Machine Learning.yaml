  - question: What is principal component analysis?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
    options:
      - It is a process of figuring out most important features that has the most impact on the target variable
      - It is a process of figuring out the principal components that has the most impact on the target variable
      - It is called dimensionality reduction technique as it can help us reduce dimensions.

  - question: PCA(n_components=6), what does this mean?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
    options:
      - Select the most important 6 features
      - Select 6 principal components
      - Run PCA 6 times

      - 0

  - question: Accuracy might drop due to PCA.
    options:
      - Yes
      - No
    answers:
      - 0

  - question: Select the correct options related to curse of dimensionality.
    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - The curse of dimensionality basically means that the error increases with the increase in the number of features.
      - It refers to the fact that algorithms are harder to design in high dimensions and often have a running time exponential in the dimensions.
      - A higher number of dimensions theoretically allow more information to be stored, but practically it rarely helps due to the higher possibility of noise and redundancy in the real-world data.

  - question: PCA(0.95) what does this mean?
    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - Retain 95% of the useful features of the dataset.
      - Same as PCA(n_components=6)
      - Same as PCA(n_components=10)
