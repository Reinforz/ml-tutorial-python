topic: Machine learning
subject: Gradient Descent and Cost Function
questions:

  question: Gradient descent is an ___ that finds the ___ line for a given training data set.
  answers:
    - algorithm
    - best fit

  question: Why are we looking into gradient descent?
  answers:
    - 0
    - 1
  options:
    - better understand how libraries like sklearn work 
    - get a clear idea how we get the best fit line
    - absolutely vital to know in order to become an AI expert

  question: Why are the deltas are sqaured in mean squared error?
  answers:
    - 1
    - 2
  options:
    - squaring is essential while working with gradient descent
    - squaring eliminates negative delta values thus no chance of getting skewed outputs
    - increases the accuracy of the best fit line

  question: Mean squared error is a type of ?
  answers:
    - 3
   options:
    - delta function
    - error function
    - sigma function
    - cost function

  question: We should keep tweaking the learning rate until the cost values decrease gradually.
  answers:
    - 0
  options:
    - True
    - False
