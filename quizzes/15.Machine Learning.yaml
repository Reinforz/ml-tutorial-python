questions:
  - question: In Naive Bayes, the Bayes comes from Bayes probability theorem. However, why is it called 'Naive' Bayes?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
    options:
      - Because we makes naive assumptions
      - for example, in titanic survival probability, we made the naive assumption that features such as cabin, fare etc are independent of each other.
      - But in reality fare and cabin are in someway related.

  - question: Select the use cases of naive bayes classifier.
