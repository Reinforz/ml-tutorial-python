questions:
  - question: How many types of categorical values?
    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - 2
      - 3
      - 4

  - question: Which categorical value has some sort of relation between its values?
    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - ordinal

  - question: What is the dummy variable trap?
    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - The Dummy variable trap is a scenario where there are attributes that are highly correlated (Multicollinear) and one variable predicts the value of others.
      - The Dummy variable trap is a scenario where there are attributes that are moderately correlated (Multicollinear) and one variable predicts the value of others.
      - The Dummy variable trap is a scenario where there are attributes that are highly correlated (Multicollinear) but one variable cannot predict the value of others.

  - question: How to fix the dummy variable trap?
    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - drop 1 dummy variable column
      - add 1 more dummy variable column

  - question: What is one hot encoding?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 2
    options:
      - With one-hot, we convert each categorical value into a new categorical column and assign a binary value of 1 or 0 to those columns. Each integer value is represented as a binary vector.
      - With one-hot, we convert each categorical value into a new categorical column and assign a decimal value from 0 to 9 to those columns. Each integer value is represented as a decimal vector.
      - One hot encoding is one method of converting data to prepare it for an algorithm and get a better prediction.

  - question: One hot encoding can be done using both panda dataframe and sklearn library.
    options:
      - True
      - False
    answers:
      - 0
