  - question: In case of support vector machine, the margin between support vectors are best if they are greatest.
    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - True
      - False

  - question: Select the correct options about gamma in support vector machines.
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
    options:
      - the gamma parameter defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches,
      - The gamma parameters can be seen as the inverse of the radius of influence of samples selected by the model as support vectors.
      - low values meaning 'far' and high values meaning 'close'.

  - question: What is the differnce between high regularization and low regularization?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
    options:
      - high regularization is almost overfitting a model when dealing with complex datasets
      - low regularization might have some classifcation errors but has less computation stress
      - high regularization might have some classifcation errors but has less computation stress

  - question: A kernel is when we add a new dimension or transform an existing features so that we may have a decision boundary.
    options:
      - Yes
      - No
