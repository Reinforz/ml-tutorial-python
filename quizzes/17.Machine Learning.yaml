    options:
      - Hyperparameter tuning is choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm.
      - A hyperparameter is a model argument whose value is set before the learning process begins.
      - C parameter in random forrest algorithm for Machine learning is a hyperparameter.

  - question: What is the benefit of using Gridsearch CV of Sklearn library?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 2
    options:
      - It makes hyper parameter tuning very easy as we can do that in one line of code.
      - It is absolutely essential for hyper parameter tuning.
      - Randomised Gridsearch is also available to hyper parameter tune large datasets.
