    options:
      - Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample.

      - The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into.
      -
      - The approach involves randomly dividing the set of observations into k groups, or folds, of approximately equal size. The first fold is treated as a validation set, and the method is fit on the remaining k-1 folds.

  - question: If we have a dataset of 100 samples and we want to run K Fold Cross Validation with k=5, how many samples will each fold set have?
