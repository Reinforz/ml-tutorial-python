subject: K nearest neighbors classification
questions:
  - question: What is k nearest neighbors classification?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
    options:
      - K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
      - You find out the most near K neighbors. And based on that number of neighbors, we classify our new datapoint.
      - The value of is found through trial and error. It should not be too high or too low.
