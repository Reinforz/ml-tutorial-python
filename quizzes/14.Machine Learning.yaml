  - question: Select the correct options regarding k means clustering algorithm.
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
    options:
      - It is an iterative algorithm that divides the unlabeled dataset into k different clusters in such a way that each dataset belongs only one group that has similar properties.
      - It allows us to cluster the data into different groups and a convenient way to discover the categories of groups in the unlabeled dataset on its own without the need for any training.
      - It is a supervised machine learning algorithm.

      - 0
    options:
      - Elbow Method
      - Elbow Operation
      - K Means algortims.

    options:
      - In the center of gravity of given clusters
      - In the center of mass of given clusters.
      - At the center of clusters
